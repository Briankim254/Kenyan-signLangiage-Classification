# Kenyan Sign Language Classification

Welcome to the Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) Classification repository! This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to recognize ten everyday KSL signs in images, addressing the bias present in many sign language datasets. The model was developed using Jupyter Notebook, and the dataset was collected by Task Mate for a Zindi competition.

## Introduction

The Kenyan Sign Language Classification project aims to provide an accurate and unbiased recognition model for KSL signs. With a focus on inclusivity, this project helps address the underrepresentation of people of color in sign language datasets, ensuring a more equitable solution for KSL recognition.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was collected specifically for a Zindi competition by Task Mate. It consists of images featuring ten different everyday KSL signs, with a focus on hands of people of color. This approach helps to address bias in sign language datasets and contributes to a more inclusive model.

## Model Development

The KSL classification model was developed using Jupyter Notebook and relies on machine learning or deep learning algorithms to accurately recognize the ten KSL signs present in the dataset. The model was trained and validated using a portion of the dataset and achieves high accuracy in KSL sign recognition.

## Getting Started
